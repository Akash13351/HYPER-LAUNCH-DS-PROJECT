===============================
Calories Burned Prediction App
===============================

Project Overview:
-----------------
This project is a simple, interactive data analysis application built using Python. It uses machine learning to predict calories burned based on a person's physical and workout-related attributes. The application includes data preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation steps.

Features:
---------
- Reads and processes fitness and workout data (CSV file)
- Handles outliers and missing values
- Performs univariate and bivariate analysis
- Trains regression models to predict calories burned
- Visualizes results with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Offers a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction

Dataset Used:
-------------
Title       : Gym Members Exercise Tracking  
Source link :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/gym-members-exercise-dataset
File Format : CSV  

Dataset Attributes:
- Gender
- Age
- Height
- Weight
- Duration
- Heart Rate
- Body Temperature
- Calories Burned

Target Variable: Calories Burned

Technologies Used:
------------------
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

How to Run:
-----------
1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open it in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells step-by-step to:
   - Load and clean the data
   - Explore visualizations
   - Train a regression model
   - Evaluate model performance
   - Use the CLI to interact with the analysis

Models Used:
------------
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor (optional)

Evaluation Metrics:
-------------------
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- RÂ² Score

Visualizations:
---------------
- Boxplot of calories burned by gender
- Correlation heatmap of all features
- Scatter plot of actual vs predicted calories
- Histogram of calorie distribution
- Feature importance bar chart (for tree-based models)

User Interaction:
-----------------
A simple CLI allows users to: 
- View summary statistics
- Choose different visualizations
- Train the model
- View prediction results and evaluation metrics

Project Objective:
------------------
To build a machine learning pipeline that accurately predicts the number of calories burned based on exercise data and provides actionable insights through visual analysis.
